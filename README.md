## Matrix profile
The Matrix Profile is a data structure that measures the similarity between different subsequences in a time series. It helps identify repeated patterns (motifs) and anomalies in the data. Anomalies are often detected as spikes or peaks in the Matrix Profile, indicating instances where a subsequence deviates significantly from the overall patterns present in the time series.
